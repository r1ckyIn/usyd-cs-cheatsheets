A collection of exam cheatsheets for University of Sydney Computer Science courses. Created by students, for students.

## 🎯 Purpose

As a Computer Science student at the University of Sydney, I understand how tedious and time-consuming it can be to organize study materials during exam season. This repository aims to help fellow students by providing well-structured, comprehensive cheatsheets for various CS courses.

**I hope this spirit of open-source sharing can be passed on!**
